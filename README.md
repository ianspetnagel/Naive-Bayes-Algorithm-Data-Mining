# Naive-Bayes-Algorithm-Data-Mining

For this project I am Data Mining using the Naïve Bayes algorithm for two different datasets. This is a probabilistic classifier assuming independence between features, The algorthm will calculate the probability of a certain input belonging to a specific class based on its features and training data. Generally, the Naïve Bayes algorithm is pretty efficient and accurate. 

*Please reach out to me on LinkedIn if you would like the datasets sent to you*

**Problem 1**

For this project I am Data Mining using the Naïve Bayes algorithm. The first problem we will be using the IRIS dataset introduced in the lecture. K=3 for each of the flowers. It has 150 data points across Sepal length and width, as well as Petal length and width. The three types of flowers are Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica.
